        "\n",
        "<br>1) re. compile()\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2 Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) By using raw strings, Python treats backslashes as literal characters instead of escape sequences. This makes it easier to write regular expressions without having to worry about escaping every backslash in the pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3 What is the return value of the search() method?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The search() method returns the index (position) of the first match.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q4 From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) Expression is made up of operators and operands\n",
        "<br>2) When expression execute it produces some value.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5 In the regex which created from the r&#39;(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover?\n",
        "Group 2? Group 1?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q6 In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell\n",
        "a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1)Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q7 The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of\n",
        "the two options?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) If the regex has no groups, a list of strings is returned. If the regex has groups, a list of tuples of strings is returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q8 In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The | character signifies matching “either, or” between two groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9 In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) which character ?not mentioned\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q10 In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The + matches one or more. The * matches zero or more.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q11 What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The {4} matches exactly three instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches between four and five instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12 What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q13 What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes match a single character that is not a digit, word, or space character, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q14 What is the difference between .* and .*?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The .* performs a greedy match, and the .*? performs a nongreedy match.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q15 What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) Either [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q16 What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) Passing re.I or re.IGNORECASE as the second argument to re.compile() will make the matching case insensitive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q17 What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), then the dot will also match newline characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q18 If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return??**\n",

        "<br>1) 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q19 What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile()\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q20 How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:**\n",

        "<br>**'1234' (which lacks commas)**\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>1) re.compile(r'^\\d{1,3}(,{3})*$') will create this regex, but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q21 How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:**\n",
